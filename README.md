# Collective Bird Motion FSM
A future state maximization (FSM) algorithm that generates "flock" behaviour among independent agents

The algorithm was based on the following paper - Charlesworth, H. J., & Turner, M. S. (2019). Intrinsically motivated collective motion. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1822069116
